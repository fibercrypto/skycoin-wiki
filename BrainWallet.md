Skycoin wallets are deterministic. The addresses are generated from a 256 bit seed. Minimum entropy of the wallet generation seed should be 256 bits.

A typical wallet seed is 64 characters in hex and appears as
```
f399bd1b78792da9cc49b1157c73016450c949df565ce3ddbf2f9d65fd8f0dac
```

This is a visual standard for representing 256 bit wallet seeds in a visual format that can be committed to memory. The format is designed to be easy to remember and has built in redundancy to allow for error correction.
